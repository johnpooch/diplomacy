## Contributing

Thank you so much for considering contribution towards this project. We welcome
contributors at experience level. Our only requirement is that contributors are
enthusiastic and kind towards other contributors - leave the back stabbing and
treachery on the board!

### Adding issues

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one][new issue]! To
avoid duplicate issues, make sure you've carefully checked the existing issues
before creating a new one.

Make sure you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your
feature request before you start trying to solve the problem.

If you have a general question about the project, send me an email.

### Get started on an issue

If you see an issue that you think you can solve, follow the steps in the
README for getting a working copy up and running and create a new branch for
your work.

Our naming convention for branches is `<contributor_name>-<issue_description>`.

```sh
git checkout -b john-add-finalize-orders-view
```

### Implement your bug fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help;
everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

### Check your changes using the client application.

You should set up a working copy of the client application so that you can
ensure that your changes are working correctly on the client.

### Code style

We use Flake8 for python code style. Make sure that you set up a Flake8 code
linter on your editor so that your contribution fits our style conventions.

### Make a Pull Request

Once you're happy with your changes, push your branch and [create a pull
request][make a pull request]. Try to make a helpful PR comment so the context
of the changes is easy to understand. Add [me][johnpooch] as a reviewer.

I'll review the changes and provide feedback. Please remember that I am
incredibly grateful to anyone who contributes to the project and that any
feedback that I provide is purely to preserve a high quality code base.
